    "* Graphs are great at representing and storing heterogeneous and interconnected information in a structured manner, effortlessly capturing complex relationships and attributes across diverse data types.\n",
    "* In contrast, vector databases often struggle with such structured information, as their strength lies in handling unstructured data through high-dimensional vectors.\n",

    "* Constructing a knowledge graph is typically the most challenging step in leveraging the power of graph-based data representation.\n",
    "* It involves gathering and structuring the data, which requires a deep understanding of both the domain and graph modeling. \n",
    "* To simplify this process, we have been experimenting with LLMs. LLMs, with their profound understanding of language and context, can automate significant parts of the knowledge graph creation process. \n",
    "* By analyzing text data, these models can identify entities, understand the relationships between them, and suggest how they might be best represented in a graph structure. "
